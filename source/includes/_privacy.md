# Data Privacy

While using every feature, AIbro needs your data access in different levels. Usually, the more open accesses a feature
need the better experience you will have (e.g. more time/money saving). Of course, whether using those features is totally upon your decision.
By default, online_fit won't have any access. The following table gives you a privacy overview of each feature.

| Feature        | Server access | Model Access | Data Access | Reason                                                                                                                         |
