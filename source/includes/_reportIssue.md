# Report Issue

If your training job met any issue, you could reach out us by one of the following ways:

1. **Most recommend**: [Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/aipacainc/shared_invite/zt-s85idjfp-f~UwkvwuWi3TD1eTud4n5A) to direct message our support team
2. Use the "Contact Us" button from our [website](https://aipaca.ai)
3. Email us by <a href = "mailto: hello@aipaca.ai">hello@aipaca.ai</a>

## Record your job

We would appreciate if you turned on the record parameter in [online_fit()](<#online_fit>) before reporting an issue. In recorded jobs, AIbro stores the model & data to [replay](#replay_job) the issue. Even though AIpaca would only use the data for service improvement purpose only, we hope you could ensure this "record" feature won't violate your or your agencies' IP privacy before turning it on. If you need extra privacy protection, please don't hesitate to contact us by one of the ways above. AIpaca team is always here to help you out.
