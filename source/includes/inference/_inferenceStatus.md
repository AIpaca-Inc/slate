## Inference Job & Instance Status

Once a job starts, its states and substates are updated on the [Jobs page of AIbro Console](https://aipaca.ai/jobs).

| Job Status | Description                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| QUEUING    | Waiting for training                                  |
| TRAINING   | During training process or returning training results |
| CANCELED   | Canceled due to some errors                           |
| COMPLETED  | Completed the job                                     |

| Job Substatus        | Description                                     |

| GEARING UP ENV       | Gearing up tensorflow and mounting GPUs         |
| SENDING MODEL & DATA | Sending model and training data to the instance |
| TRAINING             | Training model                                  |
| RETURNING            | Returning trained model                         |
| CANCELED             | Canceled due to some errors                     |
| COMPLETED            | Completed the job                               |

| Instance Status | Description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| LAUNCHING       | Setting up instance for training         |
| EXECUTING       | Having jobs in training process          |
| COOLING         | Within [Cooling Period](#cooling-period) |
| CLOSING         | Stopping/terminating instance            |
| CLOSED          | instance has been stopped/terminated     |

| Instance Substatus     | Description                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STOPPING/STOPPED       | Shut down instance but retain root volume [Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html) |
| TERMINATING/TERMINATED | Completely delete the instance [Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html) |

In the AIbro usage case, [Setup speed](#setup-speed) is the main advantage of stopped instance over terminated instance.

The following table is a status-substatus map of jobs and instances.
